-  uncertainty related to exponential 
- coplexity payoff for discretization 
- furier sampling?
- It has been suspected for many years that Fourier Sampling is a problem that exists within BQP, but not within the polynomial hierarchy. Recent conjectures have provided evidence that a similar problem, Fourier Checking, also exists in the class BQP without being contained in the polynomial hierarchy. This conjecture is especially notable because it suggests that problems existing in BQP could be classified as harder than NP-Complete problems. Paired with the fact that many practical BQP problems are suspected to exist outside of P (it is suspected and not verified because there is no proof that P â‰  NP), this illustrates the potential power of quantum computing in relation to classical computing.[7]
-  exponential hypothesis?
- qunatum tomography needs alot of enegry
- abelin agroup problem ncoding
- discritization of x and p
- grover for searching the original problem
- Qft , take out the peaks

- Heisenberg equation commutator generator , covariance matrix symmetric and anti symmetric as an expansion on this , look up at the Heisenberg equations of motions

## Action Items
- [ ] look about the discretization
- [ ] check out the qft , groover not smart partitions sqrt, qft is exponential speedup but something is missing
